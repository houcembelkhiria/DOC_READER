There are two main approaches to summarization:

Extractive
Abstractive
Extractive summarization selects and combines important sentences, phrases, or passages directly from the original text to form a summary. It acts like a “highlighter,” picking existing content.

Original Text:
“The company announced a 10% cost-cutting strategy to improve profitability. Additionally, a new product line will launch in Q2 2024, targeting younger demographics. CEO Jane Doe emphasized sustainability as a core focus.”
Extractive Summary:
“The company announced a 10% cost-cutting strategy to improve profitability. A new product line will launch in Q2 2024, targeting younger demographics.”
Abstractive Summarization generates a summary by paraphrasing and synthesizing the original content, often using new words or phrases not present in the source. It mimics human-like understanding and rewriting.

Original Text:
“A recent study found that 30 minutes of daily exercise reduces stress and anxiety levels by 25%. Participants reported improved sleep and mood over a 12-week trial.”
Abstractive Summary:
“Research indicates regular exercise significantly lowers stress and anxiety while enhancing sleep and mood, based on a three-month study.”
Extractive summarization relies on algorithms like TextRank or TF-IDF to rank sentence importance. On the other hand, abstractive summarization uses advanced generative models like BART, T5, or GPT to generate language.
